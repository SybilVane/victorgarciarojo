          <h2>Multidisciplinary Artist</h2>
          <p>
            I love developing games using 2D, 3D, pixel art, animation, and
            traditional art, with a passion for art direction and creative
            production. <br />
            During my experience of more than 16 years in the industry, I have
            worked for companies such as Pyro Studios, Wayforward Technologies,
            Play Wireless, Lemonquest, and a wide range of indie developers.
